With this markup you can obtain *italic*, **bold** 
or `monospace` text, you may use also _this_ or
__this__ notation to emphatize text, and, yes, you 
can use all them ***`together!`*** (and you can mix * and 
_ )


If you look at the source code you may note that
even 
if 
you 
break 
the 
lines 
the text is kept together
in a single paragraph, unless you leave a blank 
line
