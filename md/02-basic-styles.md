With this markup you can obtain *italic*, **bold** 
or `monospace` text, you may use also _this_ or
__this__ notation to emphatize text, and, yes, you 
can use all them ***`together!`*** (and you can mix * and 
_ )


If you look at the source code you may note that
even 
if 
you 
break 
the 
lines 
the text is kept together
in a single paragraph

 Paragraphs are delimited by blank lines, leading 
and trailing spaces are removed 

You may force a line break with two spaces  
or with a \
at the end of the line
