Basic styles
------------

With this markup you can obtain *italic*, **bold** 
or `monospace` text, you may use also _this_ or
__this__ notation to emphatize text, and, yes, you 
can all them ***`together!`*** (and you can mix * and 
_ )

eve if you break the line the text is kept together
in a single paragraph, unless you leave a blank 
line
