Links
-----

 - You can insert links in text like 
 [this](http://agea.github.io/tutorial.md)

 - You may add a 
 [title](http://agea.github.io/tutorial.md "Markdown Tutorial") 
 to your link (can you see the tooltip?):

 - If your link contains spaces you have to write
 the link in [this](<http://example.com/a space>) way
 
 - You can use spaces and markup inside the
 [link **text**](http://agea.github.io/tutorial.md)

 - Long links may decrease source readability, so
 it's posible to define all links somewhere in the
 document (the end is a good place) and just reference
 the [link][tutorial.md], you may also collapse the 
 reference if it matches the link text
 (example:  [tutorial.md][])
