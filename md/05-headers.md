There are two ways to define headers, so you can 
give structure to your documents

The biggest possible header
===========================

# You can also use this markup

(I prefer the first one as it's more readable when 
looking directly at the source code, but the two 
formats give the same results)
 
A sub heading
-------------
 
## This is the alternative format

### Then you can go smaller

#### And smaller

##### And even smaller

###### No, you can't go smaller than this

The good thing is that many tools that convert 
markdown in HTML or PDF are able to generate the 
index or links to the headers automatically
