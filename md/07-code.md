If you have to insert code in your document you 
have tree choiches:
 - inline code like this: `echo "Hello World"`
 - fenced code blocks (you may use ` ``` ` or `~~~` 
   as delimiters): 
   ``` markdown
   *Hello* **World!**
   ```
- indented code blocks


    *Hello* 
    
    **World!**

You need to leave a blank linke after a paragraph 
and 2 blank lines after a list to start an indented 
code block (if you want the code to be out of the 
list), and you may insert the name of the language 
immediatly after the opening code fence (so some 
renderers may be able to highlight the syntax of 
the language)
