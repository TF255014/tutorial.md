If you have to insert code in your document you 
have tree choiches:
 - inline code like this: `echo "Hello World"`
 - fenced code blocks (you may use ` ``` ` or `~~~` 
   as delimiters): 
   ``` markdown
   *Hello* **World!**
   ```
- indented code blocks


    *Hello* 
    
    **World!**

You need to leave a blank linke after a paragraph 
and 2 blank lines after a list, and you may insert 
the name of the language immediatly after the opening
code fence (so some renderers may be able to hilight 
the syntax of the language)
